## Recording Tips

1. **Script Your Demo**: Write a script before recording to ensure you cover all important points efficiently.

2. **Practice the Flow**: Rehearse navigating through the app to avoid awkward pauses or mistakes.

3. **Use Screen Recording Software**:
   - Windows: Built-in Xbox Game Bar (Win+G) or OBS Studio
   - Mac: QuickTime Player or OBS Studio
   - Consider recording your voice separately for better audio quality

4. **Add Narration**: Explain what you're demonstrating as you navigate through the app.

5. **Keep It Concise**: Focus on the value proposition and unique features rather than technical details.

6. **Add Captions/Text**: Highlight key points with on-screen text.
